##### Submission and Grading

In addition to submitting your source for this project in a single file called TM.java, you must also submit a short write-up outlining your approach and justifying your design decisions. Don't ask me about the format. Imagine I'm paying you for this, you aren't going to ask your customer what format he would like, you are going to create a fantastic document that screams "I want you to keep giving us money to write you software."  Your project will primarily be graded on script based grading but will also be assessed on code quality and the quality of your write-up.

There is a hard formatting requirement for this submission. Your code must not wrap when viewed in speed grader. This means you will have to pay attention to the column width of your code. This was addressed a bit in the Clean Code video and we will see this idea later. This means that you code width is limited to 80 characters. You might want to take a minute to make sure that your editor complies with this requirement. 

#### PDF Overview Details

As discussed in class you must describe and justify the details of your design in a short document. There's no fixed length for this document, but, I don't think that you can do a good job in less than two pages and I think that you're probably overdoing it somewhere around four or so. That doesn't mean that you can't write a four page document, but let's se the hard limit at five pages and a reasonable expectation of two and a half to three pages . The more headers and pictures that you have the less space you have for writing. Focus on clarity. I'm your target audience and you want to sell me that your design is an excellent choice for the problem statement. As always, a standard latex document with 12 point font is the gold standard, but don't go trying to learn latex for this assignment. A word document printed to pdf will be fine.
